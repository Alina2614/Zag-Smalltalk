## Experiments

### Dispatch options for interpreter
This is for the "bytecode" executer
1. Just raw send
2. Caching as per OpenSmalltalk
3. Our dispatch, no inlining
4. Our dispatch, full inlining

### Dispatch options for compiler
Same experiments as above, but now generating native code for methods
